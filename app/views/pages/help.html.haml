  %h3#workflow Workflow
  %p
    Everchords was designed around a workflow using Evernote for
    writing and managing songs and Everchords as an alternative frontend
    for display and sharing. Everchords itself does not provide the
    means to edit songs, many other tools can do that.
  %p
    This is how you work with Everchords:
  %ol
    %li Create a Notebook for your Songs in Evernote
    %li Add a new note to the notebook. This not is your first song.
    %li
      Write the lyrics and chords into the note following the
      <a href="songpro.org/">SongPro</a> syntax rules.
    %li
      Connect your new Evernote notebook to Everchords, will
      list all contained notes as songs. By default all notes are
      private to you and can not be publicly accessed.
    %li
      Open your Song, if formatting is not good, check your SongPro
      syntax in the original Evernote note. If you made changes in your note
      you can refresh your song Everchords to update it.
    %li
      By default your song is private, but you can share it using a secret link.
